In DefaultTemplateMailer.java, 

boolean shouldUseCustomConfiguration = configuration != null;
			if(shouldUseCustomConfiguration)

The above code already checks if configuration is null and act accordingly, but the checker is unable to detect it.
On the other hand, if I replace it with the following:
if(configuration!=null)
The checker detects that code is not faulty.
